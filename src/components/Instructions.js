          How to win: Get 3 in a row<br />
          <br />The Catch: You must win a bid in order to make a move<br />
          <br />How Bidding Works: Each player starts off with 100 bidding
          power. Before each move is made, both players will anonymously bid a
          value between 0 and their current bidding power. The winner of the bid
          will be able to make a move but will lose bidding power equivalent to
          the highest bid of that turn. The loser of the bid will be unable to
          make a move but will gain bidding power equivalent to the highest bid
          of that turn.
